This project demonstrates how to implement a low-level keyboard hook in Windows using the WinAPI. It logs keystrokes to a file and includes basic window focus tracking. This kind of technique is commonly used in malware and spyware, but here it is presented solely for the purpose of:

- Understanding how global hooks work in Windows
- Learning about defensive programming and malware analysis
- Demonstrating how security tools detect unauthorized activity
